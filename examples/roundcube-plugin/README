Rouncube Webmailer: http://roundcube.net/

`Roundcube webmail <http://roundcube.net/>`_ is a browser-based multilingual
IMAP client with an application-like user interface. It provides full
functionality you expect from an e-mail client, including MIME support, address
book, folder manipulation, message searching and spell checking.



Description
-----------
This is a basic plugin example for roundcube. It is part of the Response
project. Call it a proof of concept implementation to enable your users to
configure their autoresponse settings.

Basically it is a cleaned up and stripped down version of Jasper Slits'
original work for the rcubevacation plugin project. The upstream version of
the rcubevacation plugin this code is based on is 1.6.

Changes to the code (if any except some cleanup) are commented in each of
the source file headers.

Most importantly, as with all parts regarding Response, you are free to use
custom SQL queries for every operation.


Installation
------------
1) Place the vacation dir into the plugins/ folder of your roundcube install
2) Enable the vacation plugin in config/main.inc.php::

   $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('vacation');

3) Open and adjust plugins/vacation/config.inc.php
4) Be sure to fix the permissions for config.inc.php so that no one except
   the user running roundcube (www-data, ...) can read it.


Using
-----
After installing and activating the plugin, you will get a new tab in the
account settings view: "Vacation", where the user may configure the Response
autoresponse_config records. As of now, they may enabled/disable the response,
set a custom subject and a custom message.


Localization
------------
We ship the native en_US texts as well as de_DE. The translation should be
pretty easy, so please contribute one :-)
